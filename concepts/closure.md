What is Closure?
================

[A closure is the combination of a function and lexical environment in which the function was declared.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures)

What the fudge does ^ mean?
  * they are called "closures" because they "close over" the lexical scope

So, what is lexical scope?
  * it's based on where variables and blocks of scope have been authored in the source code
